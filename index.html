<hr>

<p>These days most of the shopping is online with the growth of e­commerce. In this 
scenario, a customer or a user would want to know about a particular product before buying it . 
A customer service provider answers questions posed by users going through the product, 
pricing and personal information of which they have access to. So, our project is to build a 
question answering system that would answer products­related questions of the users. Through 
this project we would like to automate the task performed by customer service providers.

<hr>

<p>On a broad level the project aims to take a sentence as an input and extracts the aspect 
term form it, and tries to use a simple pattern matching algorithm to retrieve the relevant 
answers from the accessible data.
The Scope can be divided into the following levels:  
1. Data representation using appropriate data structures. 
2. Aspect Term detection in the query. 
3. Identify the right fields in the constructed data structure of the available data. 
4. Generate a sentence asking the customer to provide the required  information, if 
anything is missing. 
5. keeping track of the information in previous question, so that the context doesn't get lost. 
6. Classification of queries into bins based on the type of response like descriptive, yes/no 
question, etc. 
7. Ranking the relevant responses.

<a id="proposed-approach--" class="anchor" href="#proposed-approach--" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Proposed Approach : </h3>

<hr>

<p>● Removing stop words: Stop words are the words which appear frequently in the query but provide less meaning in
  identifying the important content of the document such as ‘a’, ‘an’, ‘the’,  etc. </p>

<p>● Stemming: Word stemming is the process of removing prefixes and suffixes of each word.  </p>

<p>● We then identify the tokens which define many of the possible domain questions and answerable token keywords 
  which enable our system to search questions more efficiently. (​ Aspect term extraction​ ) </p>

<p>● The system will search for the term that is found in Step 3 and its associative word found in Step 2. If the 
  user asks the question: “What is the warranty period for a Videocon TV model: VIDCN 12345”. Then the system 
  will search for the domain ‘TV’, then sub­domain: ‘Videocon’ And then for model number that is in the user 
  query. 
     1. If the user’s question is incomplete, then our system will prompt for the missing information. 
     2. System will auto generate questions depending on the previous questions. If the user asks for television 
        and warranty period’ in the previous queries then our system will ask further questions like ’warranty<br>
        period range’ or ‘would you interested in screen size’, etc.  </p>
